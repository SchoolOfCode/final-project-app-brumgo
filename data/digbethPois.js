      "The Custard Factory complex is set in fifteen acres (60,000 m²) of factory buildings, originally constructed by Sir Alfred Frederick Bird (1849–1922), the son of Alfred Bird (1811–1878), the inventor of egg-free custard.  He developed the recipe because his wife was allergic to eggs, the key ingredient used to thicken traditional custard. The Birds continued to serve real custard to dinner guests, until one evening when the egg-free custard was served instead, either by accident or design. The dessert was so well received by the other diners that Alfred Bird put the recipe into wider production. DID YOU KNOW...? The company was one of the early users of promotional items and colourful advertising campaigns. The famous 'three bird' logo, however, was relatively late in arriving, only introduced in 1929."

      "open Friday night from 4pm and Saturday from 12pm this place is worth a visit. Located on River Street (Digbeth), Dig Brew Co. is an independent brewery and kitchen, providing you with the winning combination of excellent beer and fantastic pizzas. Dig Brew Co. is the very definition of a hidden gem. Tucked away in the backstreets of Digbeth, it may be a little off the beaten track but it’s well worth the journey through the quiet streets (and around the odd abandoned sofa and pavement-parked car, here and there). When you spot the board outside and enter the building, you find yourself wondering ‘Is this the right place?
